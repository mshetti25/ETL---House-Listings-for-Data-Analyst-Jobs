# ETL---House-Listings-for-Data-Analyst-Jobs

In this project we are using 2 datasets (Hosuing List and Data Analyst Job). We selected 5 cities from both the datasets (Chicago, San Francisco, San Diego, New York and Seattle). 
We first loaded both Datasets into 2 separate DataFrames and then performed Data Cleaning on both Data Frames.
After Data Cleaning we connected to local database to query the required the results.
For querying, we merged the 2 tables on "City" and found Top Paid Jobs.
