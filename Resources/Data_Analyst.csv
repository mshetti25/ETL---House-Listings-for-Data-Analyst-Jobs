Vesta Healthcare is a startup with a simple mission: Delivering extraordinary outcomes by unlocking the power of caregivers. Caregivers are one of the largest, most untapped resources in the healthcare delivery system and are the unsung heroes of their care recipients. Yet despite their vital role, they are largely unsupported and invisible to the healthcare ecosystem.

At Vesta Healthcare, we enable people with personal assistance to thrive at home, in their community by assuring the people they rely on, their caregivers, have the resources, data, and support they need. We achieve this through a combination of analytics, technology, services, and deep healthcare expertise. Our analytics help identify and target the right people and populations. Our technology creates real-time connectivity and actionable data out of observations. Our services connect to real people who can help when needs arise, and our healthcare expertise helps us understand how we create value for both payers and providers.

Our program monitors in real-time, identifying issues before they become health events, and helping connect those in need with those who can help via technologies such as video, chat, and telephone. Our technology platform includes home-based mobile applications, a clinical dashboard, and data analytics on data not previously available to health professionals. We are disrupting a $109 billion industry and have just closed our latest funding round with a blue-chip list of investors.

We're looking to add to our team of experts who care deeply about our mission.

Our team is passionate, driven, collaborative, intellectually curious, and excited about the opportunity to transform our healthcare system. We're inspired by caregivers and seek to create a platform that recognizes, utilizes and supports the vital role they play. We strive to continuously learn, explore, experiment and achieve results. We are here to improve the quality of life for caregivers and care recipients, allowing them to focus on the important things (like going to the mall with their grandkids)

Share and teach skills to others on the data team

General Description

CUNY Fellowship in the Behavioral Sciences


The City University of New York (CUNY) - Office of Institutional Research and Assessment (OIRA) announces a one-year fellowship in the behavioral sciences. Behavioral science is the study of how people make decisions and act within a complex world where details and context matter. It draws from decades of research in the social sciences to create a more realistic framework for understanding the way people form intentions and take actions.

Behavioral science has been used across a variety of fields to realign policies, programs, and products with how we really behave, improving outcomes for millions of people worldwide. OIRA is testing the use of lessons from the behavioral sciences at CUNY through a project called the Student Persistence Initiative (SPI), which is funded by the Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity.

CUNY is the nation's leading urban public university serving more than 275,000 students in 25 colleges and institutions in New York City. CUNY-OIRA conducts research and provides data to improve student success and acts as an incubator for new interventions, providing rigorous evidence to identify the most effective, and taking the best to scale at CUNY. SPI is one of these projects.

Under the supervision of the Director for Institutional Research, the fellow will provide quantitative analytic support and data for the implementation and scaling of a set of behavioral interventions over the course of academic year 2020-21. The fellow will work in collaboration with partner CUNY schools and the SPI Project Manager to develop and implement projects that address barriers to student engagement, retention, and success. Planned projects include scaling multi-year interventions through Blackboard, emails, and text messages.

Responsibilities may include but are not limited to:
Conduct student data extraction and analysis (including, but not limited to, academic records, enrollment data, Blackboard analytics, and student experience survey results)
Analyze the effectiveness of SPI interventions and their impact on retention and persistence (including, but not limited to, graduation rates and transfer rates)
Analyze FAFSA renewal rates of student populations in participating senior colleges and community colleges in FAFSA Renewal campaigns
Use statistical programs such as R, SPSS, and Stata to develop and prepare data for sharing with project partners
Extract, clean, and manage data from multiple sources
Respond to ad hoc requests for information and data
Participate in weekly/biweekly conference calls to discuss project development and implementation
Produce briefings, progress reports, and materials for project evaluation based on data; present materials to CUNY staff

About Wirecutter:

Wirecutter helps people buy the right things for the way they want to live. The site was founded by journalists in September 2011 and was acquired by The New York Times Company in October 2016. Our recommendations are made through vigorous reporting, interviewing, and testing by teams of veteran journalists, scientists, and researchers. Consider us a best-of list for everyday things; a curated gallery filled with only interesting, useful objects; a thank-you note to the designers and engineers who create the stuff that makes our lives better; a geeky friend with next-level research skills who tests everything they buy so you don’t have to. The point is to make buying great gear quickly easier so you can get on with living your life.

We pride ourselves on following rigorous journalistic standards and ethics, and we maintain editorial independence from our business operations. Our recommendations are always made entirely by our editorial team without input from our revenue team, and our writers and editors are never made aware of any business relationships. Wirecutter is mission driven and reader supported; learn more about us here.

Our Company Principles:

Our principles help us create a work environment that breeds trust, respect, learning and is one that we all are excited about showing up to each day.

Seek Understanding: We are lifelong students who want to understand the world around us. We are curious to understand our readers, how we get better at our own disciplines and how we can work better together. This means we are active listeners, information hunters and empathetic.

Explain Why: Because we seek to understand, we value the importance of explaining our ideas and our understanding. This means we are constructively candid, sharing our perspectives and the thought process behind it. And then learning from the conversation that ensues. We are all teachers and students, helping each other grow.

Solve Things: We love to solve things, whether they are our own problems, our readers problems or our colleagues problems. While we often can solve problems on our own, we believe our best results come out when we solve them together.

Get It Done: We are passionate about getting things done. Whether it is our own individual work or teamwork, our instinct is to forge a path forward and learn as we go. This means we continually focus on how to turn work into achievable chunks, communicate those effectively to the team and efficiently execute against them.

Make It Better: We aren’t satisfied with perpetuating the status quo. We’re always looking forward. We live to change the world around us for the better, making a difference in our own lives and our readers’ lives. If we are being ambitious enough, this means that we will both fail and succeed and we take pride in owning both of those outcomes as long as we are learning.

Preferred Qualifications


As a member of Business Intelligence
team, you will be responsible for managing stakeholders, collecting
requirements, and performing analytics with a complex and granular financial
data set. Your primary focus will be working with business stakeholders to
understand their needs and deliver results that are timely, accurate and relevant.
In this position, you will play a key role in defining how ODC analyzes, talks
about, and views key business performance metrics. You will have the
opportunity to learn a exciting industry, work with new technologies, and grow
with the business.

You’ll need to combine
your ability in relationship building with analytical, data presentation, and
project management skills, whilst working with many functions across the Oracle
Data Cloud family, including sales, finance, marketing, and product teams, all
the way up to the executive team. You’ll need to know what data you have at
your fingertips and be able to think how you can use it to help the person in
front of you. Every day you will be playing a key role in helping Oracle Data
Cloud operate more efficiently and effectively.
Primary Responsibilities:

Front-line
Support: Be the first port of call for any queries that come into the
team. Answer the ones you can and help guide the ones you can’t to the right
people.

Requirements
Gathering: Find out today’s burning questions and work out how we can
answer them. Work out tomorrow’s questions before they’ve been asked and keep
us ahead of the game.

Report
Delivery: Make sure that the stakeholders that use our data get it when
they need it, in a form that makes sense to them. Be able to set expectations
around when they’ll receive it and respond to questions about it once they have
it.

Data
Curation: Who owns this account? Which product line is this SKU on? Which
team is that sales person on? You may not know, but you know who to ask, and
you know how to use the tools to record it.

End-User Training:
Ensure that our customers know what tools they have at their
disposal, and what they can do when they have them.

Ad Hoc
Analysis: Not every piece of work needs to be a multi-sprint project
involving a cast of thousands. Sometimes someone just needs an answer now to a
question that they’ll never need to ask again. Whether it’s done in Excel, SQL,
or the back of a napkin, just get it done.
Skills & Qualifications:

Experience: At least
4 years’ experience in a role that includes finance, sales or business analysis.
Must know your way round an Excel spreadsheet. SQL would be useful, and VBA a
bonus. Knowledge of data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI wouldn’t
go amiss either.

Relationship
Builder: Everyone’s new best friend. Works well in team efforts,
building trust and respecting boundaries. Reads situational dynamics and
responds appropriately. Influences rather than directs.

Analytical: Good with numbers. Never
loses a decimal place. Knows how many zeroes there are in half a billion.
Calculates compound interest in their sleep.

Versatility: Are you
more of a data person, or a people person? The answer is “both” – you think
like a sales person, but you feel like an analyst, and then tomorrow you’ll
talk like tech and walk like marketing. Can crunch numbers and tell captivating
stories, all with one arm tied behind your back.

Honesty
& Integrity: Does not cut corners ethically; earns trust and does the right
thing. If people don’t trust us, they don’t trust our data, and if they don’t
trust our data then what have we got left?

Nearly 1 in 10 US families with kids use Life360 an average of 12 times a day, and global membership is growing exponentially, with over 28 million active users in over 140 countries as of March 31, 2020 making Life360 the largest mobile service for families in the world.

This reach gives us the opportunity to do unprecedented good for families through our valued core offerings: advanced location sharing, private messaging, driver monitoring, help alerts, 24/7 roadside assistance, and Crash Detection with emergency response. On average we respond to 1,000 roadside assists and dispatch 200+ ambulances each month to those in need.

Offering both free and paid memberships. In addition, the company has raised over $200 million in equity financing, and recently completed an IPO on the ASX exchange giving our employees the liquidity of a public company with the upside of a private growth stage business.

1929,Data Studio Analyst,$99K-$178K (Glassdoor est.),"At Priceonomics, our core skill is making data interesting. How do you find a great idea in a dense data set? What’s the best way to present it? How do you create a story where the data is the main character?

As it turns out, there is commercial value in telling a story focused on data. Companies have lots of data, but they have less experience in using it to tell stories that will spread on the Internet.

That’s a shame, because when it comes to content marketing, people seem to actually like it when companies share exciting insights from their data. When you approach a company’s data like a journalist telling a story or an analyst uncovering a trend—rather than a marketer engaging in pure self-promotion—you can produce work that will get your friends talking and gain the attention of publications like The Economist and the New York Times.

In December, we launched The Priceonomics Data Studio, a content marketing agency that helps companies turn their data into stories that spread. Although our data studio is only a few months old, we now work with dozens of companies, including Fortune 100 corporations, “unicorn” tech companies, and small startups. Half our customers are B2B (they sell to businesses) and half are B2C (they sell to consumers).

Working with companies, we’ve told data-driven stories on topics ranging from the driving preferences of Democrats and Republicans to the average size of a bridal party in weddings across the country.

To grow the Priceonomics Data Studio and create more interesting data stories, we need help meeting the demand. Maybe you are interested?

We are looking for people who are comfortable working with data to help us turn data into content for our clients. We’ll send you a raw data file, some thoughts on the topic, and a template for how the charts should look. You’ll create an awesome data-driven article with our help.

For each piece, we’ll pay you (generally around $1000). We’re looking to work closely with people who can work quickly with data, have a knack for visualization, and can complete projects like this in approximately 10 hours or less. If you’re good at this and enjoy it, you can work on nearly as many of these projects with us as you like.

So, are you interested? We need two things from you. First, an honest assessment of if you can do this sort of work. Second, the answer to a very quick “data puzzle.”

1. A quick puzzle

Tell us the median price of booking a room in each of the top 100 cities in this data set.

You can download the data here and read the “backstory” here. This is a fictional data set, but it’s very typical of the kind of raw information we analyze for a Priceonomics Blog post or a project in our Data Studio.

More specifically, send us back a table with a list of the median price in each city, ranked from most to least expensive. Restrict your analysis to just to the ""top 100"" cities that have the most units on the market.

You can also briefly describe how you solved it, any assumptions you made, or even send us the work. If some parts of the results look odd, you can propose how you’d improve the analysis given the data available in the file.

This puzzle should be a relatively quick task—not something that requires lots of brute force. If you need a hint on how to do this, here’s one.

2. An honest assessment

Companies give us data, and we turn it into interesting stories. Here are some examples of how we used data about driving preferences, bridal parties, and consumer spending habits at the grocery story. Can you do this sort of work?

It requires making maps and tables—and telling a story. It also requires fluency in Excel or a difference analysis program like R. If you know how to use Excel, can you perform: a pivot table, a vlookup, an index-match, an array, and the mid function?

Maybe you’re a PhD student, a data journalist at a blog, or a recovering management consultant who wants to work with interesting data and make some extra money.

Whatever your situation, tell us about your background and why you can do this sort of work.

To apply to become part of this program, just send an email to jobs@priceonomics.com with the answers to these questions. Feel free to let us know anything else we should know about you in the email.

We love a good story about data, and we look forward to creating some with you.

***

We’re also hiring a full time Writer/Analyst to join us in San Francisco. You’ll work at crunching data and telling stories for our customers and on the Priceonomics Blog. If you’re interested in a full time job, complete the puzzle and then send us a message at jobs@priceonomics.com.

COMPANYLendingTree is the nation's largest online lending marketplace. That means we connect customers with multiple lenders so they find the best deals on loans, credit cards, savings accounts and insurance. Our goal is to help people save money, and we believe the best way to do that is by giving them a way to shop for loans and compare lenders so they make their best financial choices. Our CEO Doug Lebda founded the company in 1996 after a frustrating house-hunting experience. In those days, we mostly helped people find good mortgage deals. Now, we help consumers find their best in personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, credit cards, savings accounts, home equity loans and more. What else you should know:
We're a publicly-traded company (TREE).
We've welcomed several other companies into the LendingTree family to augment our efforts at helping borrowers make their most sensible financial choices.
We've built the LendingTree app and My LendingTree dashboard to give consumers tools to manage and monitor their financial health.
We still make funny commercials.CULTURE We're a fast-paced company with an entrepreneurial bend. We work hard and test our products often. We're collaborative, ambitious, candid and high-energy. Our teammates are some of the brightest, most talented people you'll ever work with. We care more about your smarts than we do about the kinds of clothes you wear (but please, do wear clothes to work!), and we're pretty good about rewarding innovation, creativity and the knack for just getting stuff done (we even have an award for employees called the GSD, Get Stuff Done).
